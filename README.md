# TFlibs
Thin wrapper on TensorFlow mean to make it easier to build networks. The code here is young and volatile. It is mostly for my own use as a way of learning about TF. Suggestions are welcome. 

PYTHONPATH must contain the parent directory of TFlibs. This can be done by running:

`source path/to/TFlibs/setPythonPath`
